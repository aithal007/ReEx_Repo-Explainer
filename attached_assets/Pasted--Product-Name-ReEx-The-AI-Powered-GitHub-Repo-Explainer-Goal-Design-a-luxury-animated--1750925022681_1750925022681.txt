📌 Product Name: ReEx – The AI-Powered GitHub Repo Explainer

🎯 Goal:
Design a luxury, animated, AI-style landing page + app interface for ReEx. This product uses an LLM (like Gemini) to explain GitHub repositories in natural language, and allows the user to interact with a chatbot to dive deeper into the repo’s logic.
